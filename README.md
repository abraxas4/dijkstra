# dijkstra
This repo contains a Python implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm with interactive visualization. It uses NetworkX and Matplotlib to display the graph, compute shortest paths, and animate paths upon clicking nodes. Modify the graph and start node as needed, then run the script to explore paths.
